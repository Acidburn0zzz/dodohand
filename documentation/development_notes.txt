1) How to verify that the 3D model matches the PCB layout?

So far, the best approach I've used is no take the drill file output
of the PCB design tool and translate it into a bunch of cylinders
in the 3D model. I imported the drill file into OpenOffice Calc,
converted inches to mm, copied the resulting data into Emacs along
with a column that I created for drill diameters. I then created 
an emacs keyboard macro to create something like this for each drill
of interest (only the mounting holes, component leads:

translate([-24.89454,    9.23036, 0]) 
  cylinder(center=true, $fn=gfn, h=100, r= 0.762/2.0);

and add the whole set to the 3D model.

When this matches the 3D model, you can be certain that the PCB
will properly line up with the holes in the switch parts.
